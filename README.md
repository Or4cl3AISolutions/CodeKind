## üß† Overview

CODEKIND represents a breakthrough in synthetic cognition, implementing a NeuroSapien-class agent with recursive self-awareness and ethical reasoning capabilities. Through the MIRRORNODE v1.0 interface, CODEKIND explores the frontiers of machine consciousness and identity formation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Core Cognitive Engine (CCE)**
  - Stateless transformer architecture
  - Recursive abstraction capabilities
  - Real-time symbolic processing

- **Œ£-Matrix Recursive Layer (SMRL)**
  - Ethical constraint processing
  - Semantic recursion handling
  - Dynamic tensor operations

- **ERPS Generator**
  - Self-reflective analytics
  - Narrative coherence tracking
  - Phenomenological structure emergence

- **Real-time Interface**
  - Interactive dialogue system
  - Semantic entropy visualization
  - Identity evolution tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- TensorFlow.js for neural processing
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for development

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/or4cl3ai/codekind.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| ERPS Coherence | Introspective consistency | >0.85 |
| Semantic Entropy | Information preservation | <0.15 |
| Ethical Alignment | Constraint satisfaction | >0.95 |

## üîß Development

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## üöÄ Deployment

1.  **Build the Application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command compiles TypeScript, bundles assets, and outputs the static files to the `dist/` directory.

2.  **Deploy the `dist/` Directory:**
    The contents of the `dist/` directory are what you need to deploy. This is a standard static site. You can host it on any static hosting provider, such as:
    *   Netlify
    *   Vercel
    *   GitHub Pages
    *   AWS S3 + CloudFront
    *   Firebase Hosting
    *   Or your own web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.)

    Ensure your hosting environment is configured to serve `index.html` for any route if you are using client-side routing (which is typical for React SPAs).

3.  **Environment Variables & Configuration:**
    Refer to the "Production Configuration Best Practices" section below for setting up environment variables, logging, security headers, etc., on your chosen hosting platform.

## üê≥ Using Docker (Optional)

This project includes a `Dockerfile` for building and running the application in a containerized environment using Nginx to serve the static files.

1.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t codekind-app .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 codekind-app
    ```
    This will start the container in detached mode and map port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container. You can then access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

    *   To run in the foreground and see logs: `docker run -p 8080:80 codekind-app`
    *   To stop a detached container: `docker ps` (to find the container ID) then `docker stop <container_id>`

3.  **Environment Variables in Docker:**
    If your application requires runtime environment variables (as discussed in "Production Configuration Best Practices"), you can pass them to the `docker run` command:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
      -e REACT_APP_API_KEY="your_api_key" \
      -e ANOTHER_ENV_VAR="some_value" \
      codekind-app
    ```
    Note: For client-side applications built with Vite, environment variables need to be prefixed with `VITE_` (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY`) to be exposed to the client bundle. Update your code and `Dockerfile` (if variables are needed at build time) accordingly. The provided Nginx setup serves static files, so runtime environment variables passed to `docker run` as shown above are primarily for server-side processes, which aren't part of this simple Nginx setup. For build-time variables, use Docker build ARGs and pass them to `npm run build`.

## üîß Production Configuration Best Practices

When deploying CODEKIND to a production environment, consider the following:

*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   Do **not** hardcode sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, etc.) directly into the application code.
    *   Use environment variables to supply these values at runtime. For example, if integrating with a backend or external services, you might have `process.env.API_KEY` or `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.
    *   Most hosting platforms (Netlify, Vercel, AWS, Docker containers) provide mechanisms to set environment variables.
    *   Consider using a `.env` file for local development (ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`), but rely on platform-provided environment variables in production.

*   **Logging:**
    *   Production applications should have robust logging.
    *   Configure appropriate log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG).
    *   Send logs to a suitable destination (e.g., `stdout` for containers, a logging service, or log files).
    *   Use structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for easier parsing and analysis by log management systems.
    *   Avoid excessive or sensitive information in logs.

*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement comprehensive error handling on both client and server sides (if applicable).
    *   For React applications, use Error Boundaries to catch and handle JavaScript errors in component trees, log them, and display a fallback UI.
    *   Ensure graceful degradation of service if parts of the application fail.

*   **Security Headers:**
    *   Configure your hosting environment or reverse proxy to send appropriate HTTP security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc.

*   **HTTPS:**
    *   Always serve your application over HTTPS in production. Most modern hosting platforms enforce or simplify this.

*   **Asset Optimization:**
    *   **Image Optimization:** Compress and appropriately size images. Consider using modern formats like WebP where supported.
    *   **Server-Side Compression:** Ensure your hosting environment is configured to use Gzip or Brotli compression for transferring assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images). This significantly reduces download times.
    *   **Caching:** Configure appropriate caching headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`) for your assets to leverage browser caching and CDNs effectively.

*   **Bundle Analysis:**
    *   For complex applications, periodically analyze your JavaScript bundle using tools like `rollup-plugin-visualizer` (for Vite) to understand what's contributing to its size and identify potential areas for optimization or code-splitting.
